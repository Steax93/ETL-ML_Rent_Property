# ETL-ML_Rent_Property
Data engineer + ML engineer project for rent property price prediction
The main idea of this project was to combine the ETL process with Model creating-evaluating and finally to make a prediction of the price for the rental properties
Description:
 First part ETL process:
- Launching an AWS instance and necessary environments inside, installing libraries and packages
- Connecting localhost to Airflow instance web server
- Connecting VS-code to AWS instance by using Host parameters
- Connecting Airflow to S3 and RedShift
- Process of Creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- Creating necessary buckets and Lambda function and connection between ASW S3 and Airflow
- Creating a RedShift database and table and prov iding a connection between Airflow and Redshift
 Second part ML engineering process:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploration data analysis
- Data preparation
- Model evaluation and performance
- Ov erall Conclusion
